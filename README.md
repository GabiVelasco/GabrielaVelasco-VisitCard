# Gabiweb Online Visit Card

This is an online visit card developed by Gabriela Velasco. The website serves as a digital representation of my contact and professional information, featuring interactive elements such as flipping cards and responsive layout adjustments. The project ensures cross-browser compatibility, offering a smooth experience in both Chrome and Firefox.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Card Flip**: Implemented `backface-visibility: hidden` to enable a smooth card flip effect for both Chrome and Firefox browsers.
- **Photo Adjustments**: Margin and photo size adjustments for a responsive design.
- **Portfolio Section**: Displays various projects, with a color scheme adjustment for better visual contrast.
- **Text and Photo Alignment**: Flexbox used to align text and photos, ensuring consistency across different screen sizes.

## Recent Changes

- Solved backface visibility issue by applying the style to `.card h1`.
- Removed redundant `backface-visibility: hidden;` declarations and refined class usage.
- Adjusted photo file formats and names to ensure compatibility across web browsers.
- Updated the portfolio button colors to match the overall site design.
- Added a tooltip advising users to press on my name to flip the card for additional information.
